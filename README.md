Week 21 Data Analytics Challenge

Background:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

    EIN and NAME—Identification columns
    APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
    AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
    CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
    USE_CASE—Use case for funding
    ORGANIZATION—Organization type
    STATUS—Active status
    INCOME_AMT—Income classification
    SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
    ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
    IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
